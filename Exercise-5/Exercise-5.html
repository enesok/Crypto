<li><p><strong>Problem:</strong> <em>Double encryption (Exercise 5.1 in BS)</em></p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E} = (E,D)\)</span> be a cipher. Consider the cipher <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}_2=(E_2, D_2)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(E_2(k,m) = E(k, E(k,m))\)</span>. One would expect that if encrypting a message once with <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is secure then encrypting it twice as in <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span> should be no less secure. However, that is not always true.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Show that there is a semantically secure cipher <span class="math inline">\( \mathcal{E}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}_2\)</span> is not semantically secure.</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that for every CPA secure ciphers <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}\)</span>, the cipher <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}_2\)</span> is also CPA secure. That is, show that for every CPA adversary <span class="math inline">\( \mathcal{A}\)</span> attacking <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}_2\)</span> there is a CPA adversary <span class="math inline">\( \mathcal{B}\)</span> attacking <span class="math inline">\( \mathcal{E}\)</span> with about the same advantage and running time.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Problem:</strong> <em>An alternate definition of CPA security (Exercise 5.3 in BS)</em></p>
<p>This exercise develops an alternative characterization of CPA security for a cipher <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E} = (E,D)\)</span>, defined over <span class="math inline">\((\mathcal{K}, \mathcal{M}, \mathcal{C})\)</span>. As usual, we need to define an attack game between an adversary <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> and a challenger. Initially, the challenger generates <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        b \xleftarrow{\text{R}} \{0,1\}, k \xleftarrow{\text{R}} \mathcal{K}. 
        \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Then <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> makes a series of queries to the challenger. There are two types of queries:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Encryption:</strong> In an <em>encryption query</em>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> submits a message <span class="math inline">\(m  \in \mathcal{M}\)</span> to the challenger, who responds with a ciphertext <span class="math inline">\(c \xleftarrow{\text{R}} E(k, m)\)</span>. The adversary may make any (poly-bounded) number of encryption queries.</dt>

<dt><strong>Test:</strong> In a <em>test query</em>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> submits a pair of messages <span class="math inline">\(m_0, m_1 \in \mathcal{M}\)</span> to the challenger, who responds with a ciphertext <span class="math inline">\(c \xleftarrow{\text{R}} E(k, m_b)\)</span>. The adversary is allowed to make only a <em>single</em> test query (with any number of encryption queries before and after the test query).</dt>
</dl>
<p>At the end of the game, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> outputs a bit <span class="math inline">\(\hat{b} \in \{0,1\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>As usual, we define <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>â€™s advantage in the above attack game to be <span class="math inline">\(|Pr[\hat{b}= b]-1/2|\)</span>. We say that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}\)</span> is Alt-CPA secure if this advantage is negligible for all efficient adversaries.</p>
<p>Show that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}\)</span> is CPA secure if and only if <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}\)</span> is Alt-CPA secure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Problem:</strong> <em>Ciphertext expansion vs. security (Exercise 5.10 in BS)</em></p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E} = (E,D)\)</span> be an encryption scheme where messages and ciphertexts are bit strings.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Suppose that for all keys and all messages <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, the encryption of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the exact same length as <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. Show that <span class="math inline">\((E, D)\)</span> cannot be semantically secure under a chosen plaintext attack.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that for all keys and all messages <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, the encryption of m is exactly <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> bits longer than the length of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. Show an attacker that can win the CPA security game using <span class="math inline">\(\approx 2^{\ell/2}\)</span> queries and advantage <span class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> 1/2. You may assume the message space contains many more than <span class="math inline">\(2^{\ell/2}\)</span> messages.</p></li>
